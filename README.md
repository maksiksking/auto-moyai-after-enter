# auto-moyai

This is perfect for a prank, you can put it in someone's autostart folder and now they're cursed with 🗿🍷 eternal drip. 
Imagine them going on Discord and starting to type something just to discover this. Perfection. *(evil arc intensifies)*

This isn't gonna spam chat (on discord for example) or anything too, cause it just adds it to the end of the message "before" you send enter essentially:

```
Example message 🗿🍷

```

and NOT:
```
Example message 
🗿🍷
```
You can also reconfigure it to any text in the script if you dare betray the sacred 🗿🍷 ways.

I made this one eternity ago, but I just remembered to publish it as of writing this. I wonder what other interesting things my 100 folder project folder hides.
